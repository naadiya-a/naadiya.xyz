Instead, stick to light oils such as jojoba oil or argan oil. I also recommend using heat when deep conditioning to encourage the hair cuticles to open and absorb more moisture.";

After washing your hair (post-conditioner), rinse your hair with diluted ACV and allow it to sit for approximately five minutes before rinsing it out. Just be careful not to do an ACV wash any more than once per week.";
